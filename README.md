# Skin-Lesion-Segmentation


— Skin cancer is one of the most common types
of cancer worldwide, making accurate and quick diagnostic
methods extremely important. Segmenting skin lesions
in dermoscopic images is a key step in early detection
and treatment. This study compares three deep learning
models—U-Net, U-Net++, and ResUNet—to find the most
effective approach for skin lesion segmentation. To make
the models effective in real-world use, the research includes
preprocessing steps like hair removal, contrast enhancement
and normalization to improve image quality and accuracy. The
ISBI2016 dataset was used to train and test these models, and
the results showed that UNet performed slightly better than
the others in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
